# exit-ticket-questions

This repo contains exit ticket questions for each of the classes for the full-stack program.

## Instructions

When contributing to this repo follow the instructions below.

1. Use the `etqs-template.md` file to create a new file for each set of exit questions in the **appropriate** folder using this terminal command:

    `cp etqs-template.md web101/class-#-etqs.md`

    > translation: "copy `etqs-template.md` to `web101/` and name it `class-#-etqs.md`"

    > or just copy/paste the file using your text editor.

2. Rename the file using numeric values, i.e. `class-1-etqs.md` but title the file with alpha-numeric, i.e. `# Web101 - Class One - Exit Ticket Questions`

3. For each class lesson assigned create three questions that help summarize lessons learned and create a retention anchor for the students and a benchmark for the instructor to measure the student's understanding.

4. The questions do not have to be in the same format each time, (multiple choice, fill in the blank, open-ended); they can all be multiple choice, or all fill in the blank. Mix it up and keep it fresh.

5. Create a comment below the question with the answer to the question inside of it.

6. Name PR - `lastName-Course#-class#` i.e `berger-JS311-class6`
